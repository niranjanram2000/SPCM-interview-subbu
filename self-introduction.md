Thanks for giving this oppurtunity to describe myself<br>
myself N.Niranjan,  i am  from andhra predesh, currently living in Bangalore location.<br>
"I did my Gaduation from Dravidian University in Jun 2021<br>
I worked on SMS Techsoft India ltd"<br>
"i have around 4+ years of experience IT industry, specially into <br>
oracle fusion supply chain modules as a functional consultant"<br>
i got a chance to work on different kind projects like implementation, support and enhancement projects<br>
i have handled different set of roles and responsibilities project to project <br>
when it comes to implementation, my roles were understanding the process of their business, <br>
business flows , how they are running there business in legacy systems<br>

going deep dive into the  session, doing the requirement gathering, Identify <br>
what are their key pain areas , requirement capturing and all those requirements.<br>
and then doing the fit gap analysis, what ever the requirement  i got is a fit or gap <br>
once we finalize the fit gap analysis, we will process the solution to the  DS140 and MD50 documents and <br>
prepare the CRP sessions like the demo sessions to the business users<br>

"so they can know the look and feel of the application, the user interface ,<br>
 so that  they can understand how the cloud works"<br>
also coordinated with the technical team to give the test data and guidance<br>
and training the users and preparing the user manuals and conducting the UAT sessions like that<br>
"and before building the br100/MC50 documents, <br>
setting the UAT instances, <br>
so working closely with the Master Data Management team for data conversion point of view "<br>

"preparing the template and working with legacy IT owners and <br>
mapping these fields and  extra data from leagacy system to this system "<br>
"so then start with the cut over activities, and on going for the production live,<br> 
after the production live we will provide the hypercare support "<br>
"in the hypercare support we will understand what are the problems <br>
we did in the data migration activities "<br>
like we have missed providing some set of roles to some users like that<br>
after the instance is stabilized , we will finish our project.<br>

 in the support, we are working on tickets based on the service level agreement like priority wise<br>
we will connect to the business users when they are struck and try to understand their problems <br> 
 the tickets will be assigned to me, first i will acknowledge the ticket and monitor them<br>
so i will do the root cause analysis by replicating those scenarios in the lower instances <br>
so that i can understand what is the problem that they are having, <br><br>


if i dont understand that much through the mail, i will connect to them through teams <br>
and ask them to replicate those issues  to understand properly from user point of view<br>
after understanding the issue, i will create  those scenarios in the lower instance <br>
and provide solution to the business users <br>
if they are ok with the solution we will close the ticket<br>
"I am good with inventory, purchasing, self service procurement,<br>
 sourcing, supplier portal, distributed order orchestration or order management, global order promising, and pricing"<br>
that’s all about my self. Thanks again for giving this oppurtunity to describe myself<br>
